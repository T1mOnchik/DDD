My life has been the same for the last 5 years.@ My name is Gregory and I work as a janitor in a concert hall@ That day started as usual. I was washing the scene for some death metal group and after that… ;main_character_2;;;;false

Listen, there must be something we can… Hello? HELLO??@Shit.@Hey, you. ;shef;;;;false
…? ;main_character_3;;;;false

I… I used to cry a lot as a kid… My brothers often bullied me. ;main_character_3;;;;false
Meh… It’ll do. Come here.;shef;;;;false
What the…;main_character_1;;;;false
Cool, right?!@Our soloist has got into an accident and now you will replace him. I'll introduce you to the band. We need to do a lot of work so you won’t disappoint me. And be sure. You don’t wanna see me disappointed. ;shef;;;;false
*Gulp*;main_character_1;;;;false
Ok, see you later!;shef;;;;false
Wait buddy;logo2;;;;false
Became a star and don't know what to do? Don't piss, now I'll tell you how it all works.;logo2;;;;false
As frontman of the death metal band, you'll need to make a bunch of important choices.;logo2;;;;false
Your choices will affect your performance.;logo2;;;;false
You can't eat applause, so the band should always be with money.;money;;;;false
Stress always haunts the stars. Try not to get cranky.;stress;;;;false
Nobody needs you without fans, so maintain your level of popularity.;popularity;;;;false
You can make a choice by pressing one of your fingers.;logo2;;;;false
Clicking on a human finger you will act just like normis.;angel_button;;;;false
By pressing on the awesome, metal skeletons finger, you will release your dark essence to perform your tasks.;demon_button;;;;false
But be careful, you never know in advance what exactly will happen with your choice, so think before you act.;logo2;;;;false
Well, that's all for now. The concert is coming soon, try not to break up the band until then!;jump_into_the_croud;;;;false
